# xml-generator
This XML is an example of how data can be structured for use in an API. APIs often use XML to transfer data between systems. In this case, the XML file organizes data for students, courses, and their course registrations, making it easy to exchange and process between different systems.


This project demonstrates how to structure data in XML format for a university API. It contains data about students, courses, and their course registrations.

## Description

The `university_data.xml` file is generated by a PHP script that organizes:

- **Students**: Information like student ID, name, major, and phone number.
- **Courses**: Course codes and course names.
- **Registrations**: Links between students and the courses they're enrolled in.

This XML format can be used for API responses or data interchange between systems.

## Files

- `xml_generator.php`: A PHP script that generates the `university_data.xml` file.
- `university_data.xml`: The generated XML file containing student, course, and registration data.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `xml_generator.php` script using PHP.

   ```bash
   php xml_generator.php
